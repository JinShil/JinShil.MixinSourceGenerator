# JinShil.MixinSourceGenerator

This is a C# source generator that simplifies class and struct composition through the use of mixins. It dramatically increases code reuse by copying members, including attributes and XML comments, verbatim from one or more implementation types to another single type.  The resulting single type is acomposition of the implementation types without employing, inheritance, extensions, or default interface methods.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use this source generator to compose a class from two implementation classes.

1. Apply one or more `[Mixin(typeof(TypeToMixIn))]` attributes to a partial class or struct, specifying the types to mix in to the attributed type.
2. The source generator scans for the specified types and copies their members verbatim into the attributed type, including all attributes and XML comments.

### Source Code

```C#
internal class Implementation1
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Property1
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public int Property1 { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Method1
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public void Method1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running Method 1");
    }
}
```

```C#
internal class Implementation2
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Property2
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public int Property2 { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Method2
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public void Method2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running Method 2");
    }
}
```

```C#
[Mixin(typeof(Implementation1))]
[Mixin(typeof(Implementation2))]
public partial class Composition : SomeBaseClass, ISomeInterface
{
}
```
### Generated Code
The above code will result in the following generated code.

```C#
[Mixin(typeof(Implementation1))]
[Mixin(typeof(Implementation2))]
public partial class Composition : SomeBaseClass, ISomeInterface
{
     /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Property1
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public int Property1 { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Method1
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public void Method1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running Method 1");
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Property2
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public int Property2 { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Summary for Method2
    /// </summary>
    [SomeAttribute]
    public void Method2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running Method 2");
    }
}
```
